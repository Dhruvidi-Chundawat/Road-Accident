#  Road Accident Outcome Prediction (EDA + Machine Learning + Streamlit)

##  Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of **Road Accident Data (India 2020)** and the development of a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the outcome of accidents given several parameters such as cause, city, and number of accidents.

The project consists of:

-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Machine Learning Model
-  Streamlit Web Application
-  Data Visualization

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA component of the project involves:

- Accident distribution by cause type
- City-wise accident distribution
- Relationship between cause and outcome
- Heatmap visualizations
- Risk and severity feature engineering

EDA assists in identifying accident patterns and enhancing the accuracy of the model.
